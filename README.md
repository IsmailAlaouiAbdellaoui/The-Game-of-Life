*The rules of this cellular automaton are the following :*

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
